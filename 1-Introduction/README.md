# What I understand about GraphQL?

- A query language.
- Client has control over data which they need.
- Querying data from database becomes very flexible.
- Also I can get many resources in 1 single request instead of making that many API calls.
- We have to define a schema first with types.
- We have some powerful developer tools like GraphQL web interface to test.
- API can be updated without versions without braking backward compatibility.
- GraphQL can be added on top of our existing code.
- GraphQL is available for many different languages.
- Was developed at Facebook as an internal project then later made it open source.
- They were making a lot of API calls which was slow then they introduced GraphQL.
